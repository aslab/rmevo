This is the repository of the RMEvo project, which can be found here:

`RMEvo Repository <https://github.com/aslab/rmevo>`_

The purpose of this project is to create an open framework whose objective is to offer an environment in where apply
Evolutionary Algorithms techniques to populations of robots.

These techniques can help the user find a solution to a problem in the robotics fields, autonomously and with no supervision.
To do this the users only have to define the robot objectives, translated into fitness functions.

As a first step, the RMEvo framework focus on the evolution of the morphological structures that compose the body of the robots.
The main tools to achieve this are Gazebo and ROS.
